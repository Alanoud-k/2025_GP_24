📖 Introduction

حصّالة is a Saudi FinTech mobile app designed to build strong financial habits for children and teens under parental guidance.
The app provides a safe, fun, and educational environment where families can manage allowances, set goals, and learn budgeting together.

Inspired by the idea of a family piggy bank, حصّالة turns daily money practice into a gamified and meaningful experience.
Our vision aligns with Saudi Vision 2030 by promoting financial literacy, responsible spending, and digital transformation in the next generation.
